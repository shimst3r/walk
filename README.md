# A Good Day For A Walk

[A Good Day For A Walk](https://github.com/shimst3r/walk) is a game study to learn about the following topics:

- background images
- scrolling floors and platforms
- music (the music is taken FREE OF CHARGE from [this link](https://www.8notes.com/members_files/164015/hisaishi_miyazaki_ghibli_book.pdf))

The game does not have a goal outside of enjoying the game mechanics and the music. If it actually is a good day for a walk, consider going outside and touch grass. <3
